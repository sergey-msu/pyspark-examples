Going through the forest is my favourite part of the walk. 
My dog Benji loves it too. 
I’m Grace. 
I live on a farm with my parents and I take Benji for a walk most days after school. 
While Benji’s playing, I stop to take a photo of a butterfly. 
I’m thinking about posting it on Facebook, but then I hear Benji barking. 
He’s jumping and running around a boy. The poor boy looks worried. 
'Benji, stop! Come here!' I call and throw him his ball. 
I’m about to say sorry to the boy, but he’s gone.
